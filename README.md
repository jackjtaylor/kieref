## Description

Kieref was created for students at Kiel University to use to manage references. 
As the university has its own referencing style in some departments, this tool
lets students input source data and get references from this tool. It also acts
as a manager and lets students save and view references later.

## Features

Developed in Python, this tool is designed to run on any platform and is highly
performant. Kieref is a simple tool for students to save time when writing assignments
or papers. As Kiel University, in some departments, has its own referencing style,
existing tools don't help students. Many must regularly create references by hand.

## Installation

As Kieref is still developing, cloning the repository is the standard way of running
the tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackjtaylor/kieref
cd kieref
```

## Usage

As Kieref is still developing, some features may be missing or not working at 
anytime. At this stage in beta, running the 'manager' file in Python 3.11 or newer
will let users access a CLI.
